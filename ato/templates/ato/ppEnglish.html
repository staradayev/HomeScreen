  <p>What are Royalty-Free Images? </p>
  <p>Royalty-Free refers to a type of license that gives you permission to use a stock image in certain ways. Royalty-Free means you are not required to pay a royalty each time you use an image. </p>
 
  <p>Generally, Royalty-Free images are images that are available under a non-transferable, non-exclusive, perpetual, worldwide, multiple-use sub-license. </p>
  <p>Non-transferable - This means the license is valid for the purchaser only. you cannot transfer the Royalty-Free license to anyone else via resale, gifting, etc. </p>
  <p>Non-exclusive - Any Royalty-Free image may be used by as many people as license the image. If you require exclusive use of any stock image, you must purchase it under different license terms. </p>
  <p>Perpetual - Perpetual means that you can use the image for as long as you wish. There is no time limit associated with usage of a Royalty-Free image (unless otherwise noted by the licensor). </p>
  <p>Worldwide - Royalty-Free allows you to use the image anywhere in the world. </p>
  <p>Multiple use - This refers to use of a Royalty-Free image on packaging and other distribution methods. Most Royalty-Free licenses allow an image to be printed/shown up to a certain number of times (250,000 or more in some cases). </p>
 
  <p>Any company that provides Royalty-Free images will have more detailed usage licenses for their images. </p>
  <p>What Royalty-Free means is that you pay for the Media only once and then you can use it as many times as you like, with just a few restrictions. In other words, there are no license fees except the initial fee and no other royalties to be paid except those included in the initial cost. Note that the maximum number of copies for printed materials is 500,000 copies. </p>
  <p>The high-resolution Media that you download under the regular Royalty-Free license may be used to make fine art prints, on a web site, in a magazine, newspaper, book or booklet, book cover, flyer, application software (apps) or any other advertising and promotional material, in either printed or electronic media, as long as the item in which the Media appears does not contradict any of the restrictions of this Terms. The list is not exhaustive and if you have any uncertainty regarding the use of the Media in a correct way please email support using [email here]. </p>
  <p>Web templates, greeting cards or postcards especially designed for sale, similar print-on-demand services, canvas, t-shirts, mugs, calendars, postcards, mouse pads or any other items incorporating the Media in an essential manner, intended to be sold are considered redistribution (if the Media is used in an essential manner). </p>
